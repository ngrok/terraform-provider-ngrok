# ngrok_endpoint_configuration (Resource)

Endpoint Configurations are a reusable group of modules that encapsulate how
 traffic to a domain or address is handled. Endpoint configurations are only
 applied to Domains and TCP Addresses they have been attached to.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ngrok_endpoint_configuration" "example" {
  description = "app servers"
  request_headers {
    add = {
      x-frontend = "ngrok"
    }
    remove = [ "cache-control" ]
  }
  type = "https"
}
```

The IdP should set the `RelayState` parameter to the target URL of the resource they want the user to be redirected to after the SAML login assertion has been processed.

Many IdPs do not support request signing verification, but we highly recommend specifying this in the IdP's configuration if it is supported.

<a id="nestedblock--webhook_validation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `webhook_validation`

Optional:

- **enabled** (Boolean) `true` if the module will be applied to traffic, `false` to disable. default `true` if unspecified
