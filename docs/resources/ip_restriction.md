# ngrok_ip_restriction (Resource)

An IP restriction is a restriction placed on the CIDRs that are allowed to

 restriction has a type which defines the ingress it applies to. IP

 public-facing endpoints.

## Example Usage

resource "ngrok_ip_restriction" "example" {
  ip_policy_ids = [ "ipp_26rOyhglKmVz5ABMOwZwPFBFXBZ" ]
  type = "dashboard"
