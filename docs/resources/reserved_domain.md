# ngrok_reserved_domain (Resource)

Reserved Domains are hostnames that you can listen for traffic on. Domains
 can be used to listen for http, https or tls traffic. You may use a domain
 that you own by creating a CNAME record specified in the returned resource.
 This CNAME record points traffic for that domain to ngrok's edge servers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Code generated for API Clients. DO NOT EDIT.


resource "ngrok_reserved_domain" "example" {
  certificate_id = "cert_26rOxyrxCJlOc0frz7MK0HQjRvd"
  name = "myapp.mydomain.com"
  region = "us"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **certificate_id** (String) ID of a user-uploaded TLS certificate to use for connections to targeting this domain. Optional, mutually exclusive with `certificate_management_policy`.
- **certificate_management_policy** (Block Set) configuration for automatic management of TLS certificates for this domain, or null if automatic management is disabled (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--certificate_management_policy))
- **description** (String) human-readable description of what this reserved domain will be used for
- **domain** (String) hostname of the reserved domain
- **http_endpoint_configuration_id** (String) ID of an endpoint configuration of type http that will be used to handle inbound http traffic to this domain
- **https_endpoint_configuration_id** (String) ID of an endpoint configuration of type https that will be used to handle inbound https traffic to this domain
- **metadata** (String) arbitrary user-defined machine-readable data of this reserved domain. Optional, max 4096 bytes.
- **name** (String) the domain name to reserve. It may be a full domain name like app.example.com. If the name does not contain a '.' it will reserve that subdomain on ngrok.io.
- **region** (String) deprecated: With the launch of the ngrok Global Network domains traffic is now handled globally. This field applied only to endpoints. Note that agents may still connect to specific regions. Optional, null by default. (au, eu, ap, us, jp, in, sa)

### Read-Only

- **acme_challenge_cname_target** (String) DNS CNAME target for the host _acme-challenge.example.com, where example.com is your reserved domain name. This is required to issue certificates for wildcard, non-ngrok reserved domains. Must be null for non-wildcard domains and ngrok subdomains.
- **cname_target** (String) DNS CNAME target for a custom hostname, or null if the reserved domain is a subdomain of an ngrok owned domain (e.g. *.ngrok.app)
- **id** (String) unique reserved domain resource identifier

<a id="nestedblock--certificate_management_policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `certificate_management_policy`

Optional:

- **authority** (String) certificate authority to request certificates from. The only supported value is letsencrypt.
- **private_key_type** (String) type of private key to use when requesting certificates. Defaults to rsa, can be either rsa or ecdsa.
